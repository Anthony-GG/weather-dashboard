# CWRU Bootcamp Challenge 6 - Weather Dashboard

## Description

1. In this challenge, my main goal was to create a weather dashboard, that allows users to search cities using the OpenWeather API to display current weather and a five day forecast to the webpage! After making a search, the previous searches would be saved locally to a search history and upon clicking a previous entry, the weather data would be retrieved again.

2. This was a way for to revisit concepts we went over in class previously such as saving/retrieving information from a JSON, event handlers, event listeners etc. but with the added integration of the OpenWeather API.

3. For this project specifically, I used Bulma CSS framework to layout the page. I wanted to try out a new framework other than bootstrap to broaden my horizons, so I learned a lot about column layouts and other components during this process.

4. While I did use a standard input box for the city input, I chose to use a Bulma control select for both the state and country selection. It was really neat getting to see behind the scenes of a common selection form we see every day on other websites!

5. Having different menus become active with adding and removing classes was neat exploration, and setting up the different menus so they would show different sets of information felt like one of the most rewarding parts of this experience.
